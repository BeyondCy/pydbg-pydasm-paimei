# Introduction

The purpose of this package is to facilitate installation of pydbg and pydasm Python modules on Windows machines.

The package carries precompiled pydasm.pyd binary for Python 2.6/2.7 of Windows x86/x64.

The package was assembled thanks to the links from [this article](http://www.securityaddicted.com/2014/02/07/howto-setup-debugging-reverse-engineering-environment-python-tools/). My modifications include incorporating all three packages (paimei, pydasm, pydbg) into one and corresponding editing of the setup.py file.

# Installation

Unpack, go inside pydbg-pydasm-paimei directory and run `python setup.py install`.
